Objective

Air pollution is the main concern nowadays. To reduce the effect of air pollution, the regular monitoring system is important. The objective of this project is to provide a service to everyone which help them to monitor the concentration of various harmful gases of their surroundings. This will also allow them to take some preventive measures in case of any hazardous condition and let other alarmed if any tragedy situations happen. This will help people to live a healthy life, as if they are suffering from any airborne disease and allergic to any particular gases, they will warn before entering that premises. The main objective is achieved by interfacing various gas sensors to measure the pollutants with large displays, mobile apps, and websites. The data based server is attached to the pollution server for storing the pollutants level. Pollution server is interfaced to Google maps to display real-time pollutants, pollutants level, and locations.

INTRODUCTION

There are many gases which contribute to air pollution and result in health hazards. so there is a need to monitor the concentrations of major air pollutants such of So2, Co2 and Co. As per recent studies in India every year more than 10 lakh dies due to air pollution.According to WHO report out of 10 people 9 are inhaling polluted air. Household polluted year-- takes the life of 13 lakh people gases every year. Proposed an environmental air pollution monitoring system that measures CO2, NO2, CO, HC & NH4 concentration using mobile sensors in the urban environment. The acquired information about air pollution in surroundings is then stored over cloud storage periodically. It uses a wireless GSM module for transferring data from the device. World Health Organization (WHO) stated that 2.4 million people die every year of a result of air pollution so, continuous monitoring of air pollution is a necessity today.

This device is useful for both industrial and domestic purposes. The use of several semiconductor sensors has the advantage of low cost, quince resonance etc. A wireless real-time air pollution monitoring system is designed using the atmega processor to measures the levels of various air pollutants.

Now, their information is transmitted to the central system (pollution server) with the help of GPRS module via a public mobile network. A storage device (database server) is attached to the central sensor in order to store the gathered information related to air pollutants for further usage. Air pollution is monitored continuously using various sensors. By comparing it is easy to find out how much the air is polluted and control measures are taken to avoid such an environment. Alarm based technology is used to make alert of the polluted environment.

Application :

Public sector : Household gases are monitored at regular intervals. This device will also produce alarms in case of fire, helping people to take control measures. In case of any adverse condition, this device is capable of generating SOS service after the subscriber's permission.

Private sector : Industries and factories use this device for providing a safe and healthy work environment for their employees and getting control over any gas or chemical tragedies.

Government sector : Providing gas pipeline to every home is a good initiative taken by our government.This device will let the authorities informed about any kind of leakage in the pipeline and at the consumer's house. This device should be installed at colleges, schools, hospitals, airports, railway stations etc to provide air quality index of their surroundings.This device plays a vital role in transforming India in the field of Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) because at present the technology we are using is not including the gas concentration with the real-time positioning and timing services.

*the proposed idea requires small initiatives from the government for mounting the device over public transports.

*** Estimated budget required for the device is approximately Rs. 3500

STEPS FOR COMPLETION OF THIS PROJECT:

Circuit Design: Interfacing of all the sensors and different module to the microcontroller through circuit connection. Connecting the microcontroller to the cloud with the help of GSM or Wi-Fi module. The final data is retained in an .csv file for applying Machine learning algorithm.
Coding: Burn the microcontroller with the appropriate code for the specified sensors and different modules.
As well as the application of Machine learning algorithm on the data sheet of concentration value of pollutants to predict the AQI index.

Implementation : The circuit connections take the form of a robust model by interfacing with all the IOT based devices to transmit the monitored data over cloud storage and on the counterpart, we have to implement at the receiver's end.

Service Providing: The proposed idea will get the platform of high accuracy monitoring data when the device will get mounted over vehicles to provide real-time Data of Air Pollutants of the route in which it travels will be collectedand map can be plotted for the significance of air pollution.

  **The Prototype:**
This is workable solution prototype and we tried to make it so compact such that it merely of the size of our smartphones.
The prototype be a model on which further work can be done to make it more compact.
The cost of the device is very low as compared to other monitoring systems.
It can be powered with just a power as it is handy and portable.

Results and peformed output:

The prototype model is been performed successfully on the cloud platform.
The resultant model has sensor fully operational and the data is collected on the cloud platform.
As we were left with the constrained so used only one sensor for the implementation of the algorithms.
The Machine learning algorithm is applied on one dataset from the cloud to show how we will implement for combination of dataset to give out the AQI.
The final device will be a compact plug-n-play model with all architecture under the small box.
